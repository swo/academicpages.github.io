# Scott Olesen for DC Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC) Single Member District 1C05

Contact: <anc@scottolesen.com>

## Constituent-response and transparent

My job would be to represent the 2,000 or so people who live in 1C05. A big part of that job is listening to you. Another part is listening to all our neighbors, to equitably balance our interests across many issues. I can’t promise I will do everything you hope for, but I can promise to be honest and open about how I will vote and why.

## Pro-transit for higher quality of life

There is a place for all forms of transit in our neighborhood. Personally, I walk to Safeway, ride my bike to the office, ride the bus when it’s rainy, take the Metro to DCA and IAD, and drive my car to visit family in Northern Virginia.

I support the [Columbia Road NW Bus Priority Project](https://buspriority.ddot.dc.gov/pages/columbiardnw). It will make the 42/43 bus faster and will make biking on Columbia Road safer. We need more projects like this. I will work with citizens and DDOT to minimize disruptions during construction.

I like city-subsidized parking as much as the next guy, but I would prefer transit and development projects that favor housing and public transit over private vehicle storage.

## Pro-density for better affordability

Economists agree that the way to bring down housing prices overall is to build more housing. And the only way to add more income-restricted, subsidized units is with new development.

I will work to help **redevelop [SunTrust Plaza](https://www.axios.com/local/washington-dc/2024/05/31/suntrust-plaza-adams-morgan-plans)** (1800 Columbia Road). For 8 years, a neighborhood of 20,000 people has wrangled over the fate of just 50 apartment units.

I hate construction noise as much as the next guy, but I’d rather support development to produce a vibrant, dense neighborhood with even more places to shop and eat within walking distance.

## Data-informed

There is no need to "fly blind" when planning our neighborhood. In my day job, I’m a public health data scientist and epidemiologist. Just like in public health, our neighborhood planning should look to local data to understand the local situation and look to broader lessons learned and best practices when making big decisions.

## What are ANCs?

[ANCs](anc.dc.gov) are DC’s most local form of government. [ANC 1C](https://anc1c.org/) is the [greater Adams Morgan area](https://anc1c.org/index.php/anc1c-meeting/about-us). Single Member District 1C05 is only part of Lanier Heights.

ANCs are liaisons between neighborhood citizens, DC Council and agencies, the Mayor’s office, and some federal agencies. They write non-binding resolutions that are the official voice of the neighborhood, connect constituents with government services, and give small grants.
